       <p id="about">Union College encourages students from all faith backgrounds to find their God-designed potential for leadership, scholarship and service. At Union, students develop spiritual and professional gifts; find professors who care for and respect the individual; and seize opportunities to create, learn and connect.

An accredited, comprehensive college, Union offers active learning in a vibrant Christian atmosphere where students connect the classroom and their world. With a focus on undergraduate studies, Union’s nurturing environment offers a traditional liberal arts education combined with practical experiences such as internships, academic and career counseling, study abroad and volunteer opportunities. An honors program challenges high academic achievers, and Union’s Teaching Learning Center helps students of all academic abilities achieve their full potential.

In the comfortable campus atmosphere, professors not graduate students teach classes. Students choose from more than 50 undergraduate majors, minors and emphases in 27 fields of study including a personalized degree and a Master of Physician Assistant Studies. Union’s newest academic option, international rescue and relief, is the only bachelor’s program of its kind in the United States. This high-energy major prepares students for careers of humanitarian service or disaster response around the world.

Located in the capital city of Lincoln, Nebraska, Union’s arboretum campus offers billowing trees in a sprawling park-like setting. Founded in 1891, Union’s 50-acre setting blends the ivy and brick of collegiate tradition with modern facilities.</p>
